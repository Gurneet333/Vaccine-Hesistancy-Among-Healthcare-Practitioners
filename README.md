# Vaccine-Hesistancy-Among-Healthcare-Practitioners

It has been 2 years since the outbreak of COVID19 outbreak. WHO has also declared vaccine hesitancy as a leading global health threat. Especially concerning is vaccine hesitancy among healthcare
workers including doctors, nurses as well as those who deliver indirect care services. To understand this better we performed analysis on Reddit data by applying LIWC for linguistic profiling and LDA for topic modelling across different categories of health care workers generated through qualitative
comparisons. The findings include the factors that influence vaccine hesitancy among health care workers are mistrust and misinformation between the health authorities and the health care practitioners. We think that the findings of our study can give policymakers and authorities helpful information on how to improve training and information
assistance for doctors, nurses, and medical students.
