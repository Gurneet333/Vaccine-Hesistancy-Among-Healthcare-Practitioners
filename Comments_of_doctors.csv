hki7wd2,biotech_stocks,qop3rl,Peedyweedywonk,1,0,Peedyweedywonk,"Thanks a lot, I really appreciate you taking time to answer! Regarding the lack of a phase 2 I think it might be a mix of all your alternatives a-c but mostly a). The substance in the drug is the ”end result” of the ”conversion” the body does of the current drug. So today the body has to ”convert” the standard drug into a certain substance but arfolitixorin is that substance purely. So it’s not a new molecule for the body and the FDA probably saw it as well-proven regarding safety. The problem today is that a lot of patients (more than half the population) don’t have the gene for that ”conversion” but when using arfolitixorin you don’t need that gene.

Again, thanks for the comment, it gave me some hope that it might be approved if it is at least better than the current drug. After reading some more it seems like the FDA are tough (thankfully) but probably look at the study redults holistically and can be discussed with.

The next step is that 300 pfs events occur, probably around new year’s, then they open the database and start putting together the top line data which should be available around April.

Such a vast amount of knowledge is needed today for nurses to safely care for and assess cancer patients' needs across the board. So if anyone knows of anything else that they have found helpful with oncology nursing I would greatly appreciate any other recommendations or tips. Many thanks everyone!

All of these points are so easily dispelled. Statues and monuments are venerated by populations, and in places like Egypt they could be found by so much as looking around. Refusing to go into temples predicates that those people recieved divine punishment from Allah. Aside from some places in Jordan and Northern Saudi, no temples are said to have been punished by Allah. The places that have actually had their whole population eradicated (like Aad and Thamood). As for the 'they couldn't destroy it' argument, canons and catapults are not as recent as you make think. So yeah, they could be destroyed. The ones who tried to destroy the pyramids were actually doing it to use the stone for building other stuff, not necessarily destroying it for the sake of destruction.

I focused on the area of signal processing ([ECEN 314](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/academics/degrees/graduate/phd-qualifying-exams/ecen314.html)), stochastic systems ([ECEN 303](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/academics/degrees/graduate/phd-qualifying-exams/ecen303.html)) and that's how I got here. I wanted to be in the bio area and that's why I am in this space.

You can work on designing new technology or go into theoretical work. Even the research space can be applied or theoretical.

The math is intense and gets more intense at the graduate level. Though if you go from undergrad to workforce, you really won't need to worry too much about what you didn't understand well in school as you will pick it up at your job.

The pay is good. You can work on satellites, oil rigs, air planes, microchips, biomedical tech, AI/machine learning/data science, power grid /renewable, solid-state physics. Sky is the limit.

Some insider points for you:

1. The department will not fund you most of the time as the TA positions are already filled by existing students of a Professor.
2. Ph.D. students have significantly higher priority over master's students when it comes to funding. 
3. If a Professor guarantees you funding, always ask for how many months or years of funding you will get (**do this after a couple of emails**). Usually, they might say a year and renewable. But if they hire another student that means it is 6 months of funding for you.

hes461f,Purdue,pxvo87,EngineKid2001,3,0,Chauncey_Hill,"Hehehe buddy, firstly welcome to the program. I remember going back home at 11 pm was sometimes a privilege as in a few semesters, I didn't see the sun rise or set.

It seems your TA is at least competent, which trust me is a fortunate thing to have as you won't be lucky always. There will be TA's who have no clue about the class and there is not much you can do about that.

My first advice to you, which was given to us one the first day of ECE orientation by our advisor (Angela Rainwater) was : MAKE FRIENDS, YOU WILL STRUGGLE IF YOU DON'T.

I am not saying you should cheat, you can sometimes work with your buddies to exchange kits and parts to debug issues. It speeds up the process immensely, and they can remind you of important deadlines, events, and procedures that may slip from your mind.

Always seek the TA's help early and not at the last moment. If they know you are struggling throughout the whole session, they will at least give you some credit for you effort.

Learn to use the voltmeter, ammeter, DMM, and Oscilloscope effectively to debug circuits.Your debugging skills will improve with more classes so don't give up.

Eating: I used to carry energy/protein bars and some bananas with me when I had lab days. I also made use of the panda Chinese in MSEE and McDonalds on days I had no time to step out for lunch or go to dining courts.

Sleep: I took frequent naps in MSEE on the second-floor chairs and sometimes in the computer lab. You need to sleep otherwise you will crash and burn. On the weekends catch up on sleep as well and not just work.

Learn to prioritize your health and work before your other commitment. If you are an undergrad TA, your job pays you a bit more than minimum wage so don't fight tooth and nail for that. The main objective is your personal learning and development in college. I was TA for 272 and 132 during my junior and senior years, and I left 132 for a semester to just focus on my work.  So the idea is to not chew more than you can swallow.

I took an average of 15 -16 credits per semester, I can understand your struggle. Your mental strength will get you through at the end of the day. But trust me make a group of friends especially for labs and work together.",1632954916.0,"09/29/2021, 18:35:16",Electrical Engineering 2016

gwczvya,keto,n0x4n5,CharloChaplin,2,0,skkipper0,"Strongly suggest permanently eliminating gluten if you have UC. A lot of people with AIs have found the autoimmune protocol (AIP) to be really helpful. It is very restrictive initially to get rid of almost all possible sources of inflammation in your diet and you can add stuff in to see how you feel with it. If yourself interested, you can start here: https://www.thepaleomom.com/start-here/the-autoimmune-protocol/ and you can talk to others and search through questions/info others have shared on the Facebook group AIP Support. I think with UC, you have to be more careful because raw veggies are often a problem etc, but there are lots of people who have made it work for them. 

AIP is not meant to be ketogenic. It does tend to be low carb because sugar is quite inflammatory but it allows for starchy veggies and occasional honey/maple syrup etc. Pretty easy to add in keto if you are doing AIP though, so don’t let that be a source of hesitation. Lots of people find they lose weight without worrying about carbs though as long as they stay away from AIP baking.",1619739095.0,"04/29/2021, 19:31:35",
gw9iatj,keto,n0x4n5,CharloChaplin,10,0,skkipper0,"Celiac is not the only reason to be sensitive to gluten. It is often laughed off as a fad but a lot of people realize they are gluten intolerant in some way when they stop eating it. Those with autoimmune disorders definitely find it to be a source of inflammation, but also others who are healthy. This will be controversial, but I think most people in the US and some other countries would benefit from eliminating gluten for a while and seeing how they feel when they reintroduce it.

I get a lot of inflammation from wheat, including in my joints.

For celiac individuals, gluten consumption will cause their immune system to start producing antibodies which attack the stomach lining (and esophagus I think?). For others with autoimmune issues, their immune systems will produce different antibodies which can attack different parts of their bodies including joints. I think those with Hashimoto’a thyroiditis and Grave’s disease are especially prone to this as the proteins they are sensitive to look quite similar to something in their thyroid. For people without autoimmune issues, no clue what the problem is, but many find that they can consume gluten in Europe so it might just be how we grow it or the strains in the US.",1619673366.0,"04/29/2021, 01:16:06",

gw2wnhf,intermittentfasting,mzto9s,GBP-Fan-4,2,0,skkipper0,"When you say your scale fluctuates, do you mean if you just weigh yourself twice in a row, with no time in between, it fluctuates that much?? I have a ~$15 scale and it does not fluctuate at all. There are of course fluctuations over the course of a day up to ~5 lbs based on water and food and exercise, but if you mean immediate fluctuations, sounds like an old or defective scale that could be replaced for well under $70. 

As far as body fat, I don’t think any scales are accurate. I have not looked into it so someone feel free to correct me, but as I understand it, you would want to go into some clinic that tests with calipers etc, which is probably not a super affordable option. I am not sure where to direct you for that. 

You could try taking body measurements instead - chest, waist, midline, hips, thigh, above knee, calves, upper arms, forearms - every week or two. It is actually quite interesting to compare those measurements and weight over time. For example, I saw that my upper arm stayed flabby and constant at 41-42 cm for the first 60 lb of my weight loss and then all of sudden over the course of a couple weeks with a 5 lb drop, decreased to 35 cm. I don’t know body fat percentage but I can see where I am losing fat from during my weight loss.",1619548286.0,"04/27/2021, 14:31:26",

The idea is certainly not to remain strict AIP forever, but see if you can identify certain foods which you are sensitive to. And of course AIP is not a magical cure. It sucks that you did not see any improvement in your symptoms though. 

I wonder if the single greatest issue for a lot of people is sugar and the corresponding inflammation, which you are probably already avoiding with your normal diet. You did not have that initial baseline of added inflammation due to carbs so no huge initial improvement.

I have a couple questions about how to interpret these results and my doctor has been unhelpful beyond saying that I should probably restart immunotherapy, which is logistically and financially difficult at the moment.

1. Does the high total IgE simply mean that I am allergic to something or does it give me more information like that my body is currently exposed to something that it is allergic to? So if I lived in a bubble and was not exposed to any of this, would my total IgE go down?
2. Similarly, do the specific IgE increase and decreased based on non-immunotherapy exposure? This blood work was taken a week ago, so if I now adopted a cat, would I see the cat dander IgE increase if I retested now or is just some quantifiable property of how my immune system will respond to cat dander?
3. Does the fact that my dust mite IgEs are much higher than the others indicate that if I am having symptoms currently, dust is likely to blame, or just that I am in some way more allergic to dust mites than trees but I cannot really extract information about what is causing symptoms?
4. I got allergy immunotherapy for years in the past. If I had gotten this testing done at other times, would I see high specific and total IgEs pre-immunotherapy, lowering during immunotherapy, lowest when I discontinued, and steadily increasing after?

As far as what keeps you energized - have you tried lower carb? I generally feel the most satiated and energized at 30-50 g net carbs per day.

1. Not a virgin. Nice try, though.
2. What I was trying to say is that I suspect that when women give dating advice to men, especially to male strangers, they don't give said men the *whole story*.

I am a board certified critical care pharmacist here to tell you that it never ends. What you are feeling now is imposter syndrome. It often occurs in young women, but everyone can experience this at some point or another. 

I'm here to tell you that the fact that you feel like a fraud is better than feeling overly confident or that you know everything. Those people are dangerous. You are not a fraud. You are just acutely aware of everything you don't know. This is okay. You know more than you think you know, but there's no way in hell you'll ever know it all. The key to being successful and trustworthy is being resourceful. You don't need to know everything, you just need to know where to look and don't be afraid to ask for help.

\- there are different types of cells which do different things for the organism, they have different jobs. -

""One element of this structure is the cytosceleton, an interacting network of different proteines that are somewhat resistant to outward force.""

\- but cells also need to think about themselves, there's a part of a cell called the ""cytosceleton"" which is responsible for keeping the cell safe from things that would otherwise be damaging to the cell. -

hc7t5jn,Oncology,pkpmti,machinaro,2,0,machinaro,"uhm.. all this thinking about cancer has brought up an entirely new question.. and i think it might be a little taboo to ask, but...

  
there is all this emphasis on the concept being quite involved: cancer not being a single simple thing, but this umbrella term.

  
yet.. although it's stated specifically, it seems like there is, in the popular imagination, an anticipation for a very dramatic cure.. like vaccine/penicillin type thing, super-effective, instant victory type deal. but in reality.... does anyone who actually works in research expect such a development..?? or is this perception pushed a bit like a marketing gimmick to facilitate funding? essentially..?

  
or??

  
I mean.. perhaps this one bullet solution is not so far fetched? i mean i have clue.. if we take something like penicillin, then before it's invention we might not have expected that a medical intervention could have such a dramatic infection in cases as (apparently) varied as a small cut, and then also an arrow through the thigh type situation..?

  
uhm, yeah. alright. anyways.. heh

  
then there is more of an abstract question also.. more leaning towards the topic of genetics and mutations. .. so, as i understand it.. as you age, the number of mutations increase over time, and your likelihood of developing cancer increases proportionately (or something).

  
this cumulative effect of mutations over time may also be accelerated by things like obesity, or hugging micro wave ovens or w/e.

  
from what seems to have been established elsewhere in this thread, a species ability to have mutations is beneficial as it .. enables the species to adapt evolutionarily. a species that does not have very many mutations will be less genetically diseased and have fewer instances of cancer, but the species will not be as adaptable as a more mutation-prone one.

  
but if we look at a single individual, rather than this grand scale evolutionary stuff.. can these mutations, which in some cases lead to tumors, also be good? I mean, are we talking about a purely wear-and-tear type phenomenon, or could an individual organism benefit from these mutations as well?

  
I mean, as we age, we do tend to get a bit wrinkly and so on, but we also get life experience and develop more nuanced cognitive yadi yadas. are all these mutations what it means to grow? i mean, is our development as people, and our constant genetic mutations just two sides of the same coin?

although, if the loaf is your lungs or something, then it becomes kinda difficult to dispose it it...

uhm. 

this brings me to kind of a new question, something i've wondered about for awhile actually. .

this is gonna be a pretty weird hypothetical scenario.. but.. anyway.. what if you're diagnosed with cancer, and you happen to be signed up as an organ donor. the cancer hasn't developed so far that the organ is .. ""tainted,"" and somehow you die before the cancer is able to develop, and your organ is perserved, then.. if the organ was transplanted (which i'm guessing would never happen..) would the other person's immune system be able to cope with the donors cancer?

uhm, kinda silly stuff i think, but i'm interested in the infectiousness, or rather lack thereof. the hypothetical scenario is just there to make it easier for my understanding/perception to be molded. anyway.

hc6ak8x,Oncology,pkpmti,machinaro,1,0,machinaro,"so basically you're saying that ""cancer"" is this umbrella term for various diseases which fit into this wiki description you quoted. so.. could you then say that ""tumors"" is an umbrella term that includes benign tumors (not cancer) and malign tumors (cancer)?

and when you say ""No, tumors are not like blisters at all. For starters, cancers can be fatal.""

i'm not sure this is exactly what i was going for.. lets imagine blisters, in rare cases, could turn into something fatal. for all i know this may very well be the case, and something doctors in the relevant fields know about.. i dont know.  

.. about the diabetes thing. insulin and insulin regulation aren't bad things, but when something goes wrong, we may get diabetes. obviously, cancer would be the equivalent of diabetes, but you're saying that we are so certain that tumors are not ever something akin to some adaptation? like.. squishing things in a good way, if this makes sense? not squishing an aorta so that we die, but perhaps squishing a nerve that the body wants to squish to create some balance, because we exercise the body in some weird way that needs to be compensated for by such a mechanism (the non harmful tumor)?

...

&#x200B;

hc68alh,Oncology,pkpmti,machinaro,1,0,machinaro,"hmm, this part is a bit of a surpise/head scratcher..  interesting though..

  
""So what does that mean? In this context, malignant means that it infiltrates and invades other tissues. Benign tumors grow grow grow, but they don't invade other organs. But, they can hurt you when they get so big that they start to squish other organs that you need.""

  
uhm.. i thought that this ""grow grow grow -> squish"" process was how malign tumors... oh well. so malign tumors dont grow until things are squished/obstructed or w/e.. but instead they ""invade""? hmm.. what is the difference between growgrowgrow->squish and ""invade"" then?

  
and when a (benign) tumor grows and squishes lethally, is it something completely different from cancer then? like... a different disease studied .. in a different field? hmm.

  
ok.. onward.  
so... 

  
""Tumors are never a healthy thing. The difference between benign tumors and cancer, is that cancer is malignant.""

  
ok, so the difference is that the (malignant) (cancer-) tumors basically.. have the capacity to spread (metastasize(?)) which the benign ones does not. even though benign and malign grow in a similar fashion (though perhaps at different rates or something? i dunno). 

  
and then there is also this question mark of invades vs squish.. i basically thought the only way cancer ever killed was to grow until it squished something.. but that doesn't seem to be it, really. anyway...

  
i'm still a bit hung up on this ... blisters thing. you're saying that tumors are never a good thing.. but are tumors ever not a bad thing? like.. if a tumor is benign, and never ends up squishing anything? would it be considered non-harmful then? 

  
and if we can assert that some (benign) tumors are non-harmful.. how do we make the leap into saying that they are never beneficial? 

  
i mean, before we figured it out, would it not be kind of ""reasonable"" to assume that blisters are just bad, cause they hurt and pop etc. but then with further understanding we realise that they serve some other function (that some biologists and the blister doctors know about, whoever they are). .. uhm. 

  
out of curiosity, .. if a benign tumor is not by definition harmless, is it possible for a malign tumor to be ... harmless? like.. maybe it metastazies as little and looks ugly on a medical scan but doesn't really cause any harm? heh.

Once the cause is treated, the blood counts usually return to normal levels.


It took 13 years for me to get diagnosed despite being sent to hematologists multiple times. Too many are diagnosed AFTER having a stroke or heart attack. Do yourself a favor - print the WHO diagnostic criteria and bring it to your appt. If they don't order the tests, ask why. I was finally diagnosed in 2020 after my counts were sky high.

The other thing you want to focus on is the process of testing. It seems you may have a waterfall process within each sprint. There's no silver bullet solution for this and a lot depends on the maturity of the team (rather than some prescribed process). 

If possible - present the challenge to the whole team and brainstorm what can be done to help with this. The solution will likely involve changes to code branching, how/where you deploy, how team members communicate with each other, devs helping with testing etc. Try to avoid introducing an earlier code freeze or similar processes changes that will make this an even bigger waterfall-within-sprint situation, however sometimes that is part of the initial solution and then you work on it.

My advice re PRD (specs) would be to clearly articulate what problem you're solving and define a quantitative metric for it if possible (check this then after every iteration). What are the outcomes you want to achieve rather than features you want to deliver. In my experience this works best when you have a list of prioritized items (us map, backlog, kan ban.. whatever works best for you) and you keep it up to date as you go through iterations with highest priority stuff on the top.

Try to do interviews in addition to surveys. Give them a task and observe how they use it.

Based on the approach you described you're risking the following (which is super common in situations like yours):

* you will focus on the tech stack;
* while your stakeholder will focus on the design;
* and the validation of the solution as well the user experience take a back seat.

My suggestion: keep the PRD as short as possible (or even better substitute with User Story Mapping) then start with a dynamic prototype (e.g. Axure RP) or maybe even better for your situation some low-code solution (that would even allow you to connect it with the API) and then put this in front of real users from your target group. Be creative in how you get them - offer them something, even money, and do as many iterations as possible. The end result will be much better.

I definitely agree the amount I make is minuscule compared to an employed job—the only reason I am questioning saving is taking advantage of my time: I won’t get the years back where I can put money into a roth, so I feel the need to put my earnings into it, especially since in the future I will most likely be maxing it out each year.
I also agree with your statement that I should be saving for college! In my situation, i feel as though I have a bit more leeway to put my money in other places like investments, as my family is somewhat well off.

Hi, I’m an IMG and considering anesthesiology as a residency. When I look at the medscape compensation reports, I saw that anesthesiology is near the top. Way ahead of IM or Peds. In my country nearly all the physicians get paid the same unless they do aesthetics or private practice. Is there a reason for that salary gap? 

I even saw job offers on GasWork paying $500k. I guess thats the gross though and some of it will go to taxes but still... (could you correct me if thats the net income or take home money) 

And in the job description, the working hours are not crazy. Most of them are 45-50h/week and most of them are supervision. With 6 weeks of vacation too. I don’t know much about the undesirability though. Is that realistic? 

I also consider oncology or psychiatry. But the income gap is significant. I know I’m not supposed to choose my specialty for money but living cost in a big city like NYC is too much. 

My big question about anesthesiology is if you work day and night and can’t find to do anything besides the job. Like working out or spending time for yourself, having a different hobby than medicine etc. 

Could you tell your experiences and how many hours do you work, your vacation time, the desirability and competitivenes for IMGs please? And your income would be nice too :)

Cars are distributed via dealers, who make very little from car sales and the majority of their revenue from servicing. As the transition to EVs accelerates this is a business model that requires distribution centres rather than dealerships which is why I think new automakers have a better shot than existing ones that need to transform their entire business model. Having said all this I think VW is the leader of the legacy automakers pack so they are a good bet.

""The headlines and articles are somewhat misleading and make it hard to figure out what the actual issue is (and how big of a deal it may be).

Instead of saying ""they got the wrong dose"", the article should say ""due to the low volume administered, the confidence level that an accurate dose was administered falls below recognized standards."" See here:

https://connect.ashp.org/blogs/dennis-tribble/2019/03/05/the-illusion-of-accuracy?ssopc=1

""Below 50% of its nominal volume, the accuracy of the syringe declines with the volume measured until, at 10% of its nominal volume, it delivers ±16% accuracy. So when measuring a volume of 0.1 mL in a 1 mL syringe, the best you can actually know is that you are delivering somewhere between 0.084 and 0.116 mL. At 20% of its nominal volume, such a syringe delivers ±9.5% of its apparent measured volume, so, if we were to set ±10% as our acceptable standard of accuracy, then the lowest volume we can accurately measure with any syringe available to us is 0.2 mL""""",1636839519.0,"11/13/2021, 16:38:39",

""Ted Pharmacy in Aldie administered the shots to 112 children on Nov. 3 and 4, officials said, giving them vaccine formulas designed for older children or adults but in smaller amounts.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the only one so far authorized in the U.S. for children under 12, is supposed be given to them at one-third of the dosage given to adolescents, teenagers and adults.

“Because they did not have the children’s formulation they used the adult formulation but only gave a third of the amount to the children,” David Goodfriend, director of the Loudoun County Health Department, said Thursday. “Our understanding from Ted Pharmacy is they were trying to do a workaround, which is not authorized.”

The problem with the workaround, Goodfriend said, is that when the volume of vaccine given is reduced, it becomes difficult to ensure it’s the correct amount.""

glj9ezx,bioinformatics,l9on6l,rocobull,21,0,rocobull,"Hey guys!

The main purpose of this library I created, as part of my end-of-bachelor project, is linking phenotype information (in the form of Gene Ontology terms) to their respective genes, which in turn are collected from variant information stored in MAF files (from the GDC). It is pretty easy to use (only basic Python knowledge is required) and the end goal can be achieved with very few lines of code.

I believe it has the potential of really helping researchers determine the main genes responsible for cancer progression, especially in the presence of tumour heterogeneity, that affects different genes in different ways. This way, each gene product's functions and/or locations of action can be easily assessed in an organized fashion.

With the help of the community, MutantGene can evolve into something much greater, granting (perhaps) the possibility of characterizing the actual mutations themselves for a better impact prediction and detection of ideal targets for targeted therapies. I am still pretty new to both Python and Oncology, so I am still not certain what the next step could be, but I am keen to assist in the growth of this library and will always be open for suggestions!

I’m not sure why but I never questioned it- perhaps just to patch things up and check up on me. All of a sudden he brought up our sexual experiences because “he was horny” out of the blue and I was taken  aback to say the least. He said “I know it’s not what you imagined seeing but it’s out there”. I’m not sure what he meant by that but it was rather weird and sex pesty...two phrases I would never think to apply to him but the behaviour was off. 

I explained that I was with a partner and so I didn’t like me speaking to me in that manner, in the same way that I treated other men when I was with him. I’m happy to converse with him, but i wanted him to respect my boundaries. That’s all.  He’d blocked me after that. I still can’t pinpoint why we broke up but it was after I decided I couldn’t meet him because one of his students had COVID and my dad was at risk. During the break up he actually told me to be happy and find someone who will be perfect for me as there’s someone out there. 

It was rather odd from him to bring up sex like that because he’d never disrespected me during my relationship with him and when I said no, he would back off. he was aware that i was raped at 20 and had vaginismus issues as a result  and nothing in that relationship screamed I was being used. Maybe his intentions were to use me (still hard for me to even believe this as I do not believe this was the case) but who knows.

Try bringing home some of those sample plates of both LVP and hardwood. Drop a screwdriver on it, make a few scratch marks and check out the difference. In our case we found the LVP to be very resilient! We went at it with a screwdriver and it didn’t make any marks. Just make sure you get the thick boards with industrial grade coating on top. 

Is price at all an issue for you? LVP is also way cheaper

So yeah. Maybe LVP for next 18 years then hardwood once kids are grown up and out of the house.

Thanks for your response! I agree, its absolutely key that we find ways to better account for the massive complexity of the immune response in cancer, and most human tissue models prevent us from doing this on any level. Some human tissue models include tumour cells and immune cells from the same patient, which helps us to understand what's going on a little bit, and some models vascularise over time bringing this a little closer again - though still a good way from useful enough replication of the true immune environment, lack of lymph nodes etc. Hopefully, this will continue to improve. 

That being said, of course a mouse immune system, with all its complexity and unpredictability, differs from a human immune system in immeasurable ways. There are so many variables here, and it's important that as animal models of immune response improve over time that they are properly validated against humans, head to head. Even 'humanized' mouse models for PDX work ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7312663/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7312663/)) have not been rigorously characterised against humans yet, and while there is certainly utility here - we must remember that the gold standard to compare any new model against is a human, not a mouse.",1606820401.0,"12/01/2020, 06:00:01",

However, I'm finding it quite difficult to let organic networking happen during lockdown. I've been working from home since March, and so those happenstance chats haven't really been happening. With this in mind, I have sent some emails in recent weeks trying to suss out if specific people would be interested in collaborating with me, but I do struggle with how to phrase them, and I do worry it comes across disingenuous or off putting.

I think the closest thing we have to conference coffee breaks/wine receptions at the moment is conversations happening with strangers vie social media, mostly Twitter - maybe that sounds weird, but I have made some connections online during lockdown in a much more organic way than just emailing people, and I would hope I could maybe collab with them in the future.",1600782560.0,"09/22/2020, 09:49:20",

The vaccines are not great. We could roll them in 9 months and they are good enough for a pandemic, but they only 95% effective at best. So they reduce your risk of hospitalization by 20. But being old increases your risk by, say, 200, so you'd be still 10x more at risk than a young unvaccinated. What we need is a better vaccine, which will probably take a couple more years.

Without vaccines, however, we would still only be halfway through this pandemic, and this winter would see lockdowns, curfews, shops closed, borders restrictions etc. I could not take any more of this.

Masks, desinfectant and distance in public in winter are a good idea anyway, the flu and other diseases are still around. Large crowds like concerts or christmas markets might be canceled at some point, and the health-pass is there to stay, they will probably add the flu and other stuff on it over the years.

hga90ox,conspiracy,q5wpcz,DefiantDragon,0,0,ProfSchodinger,"PCR tests are able to make the difference. The genome is completely different, so if you know how a PCR selectively amplifies a specific stretch of DNA/RNA (which you can sequence) you understand no overlap is possible. Don't you think this is easily verifiable by anyone working in a lab? The sequences of the PCR primers are published, anyone with a computer can check they cannot bind properly to a influenza genome. They bind to the conserved sequences of Sars-Cov2. If you'd say the cross-react with another sarbecovirus that could be a thing, and it has been checked. But Influenza, no chance.
Last flu season was much weaker because of measures in place. Rona was much weaker than it would have been without the measures in place. This year measures are lifted because the Rona starts to be under control, flu comes back, but as nobody got naturally immune last year it could be stronger this year. Nothing to worry too much about in many epidemiologists opinions but the msm needs stories.
They recommend multiplex tests, which will amplify both influenza and Sars-Cov2 in a single tube, whichever one is present, and you make the difference either by size of the fragment or with a fluorescent probe. It's more expensive but better data for scientists.
The level of mis-understanding and interpretation in this sub is always mind-boggling.

Not necessarily so.

This is unrelated to stereotype talk. If one can appreciate the possibility that such quickly developed and deployed vaccines (especially those based on novel technologies, such as RNA, viral vectors) may still have unforeseen or poorly understood long-term consequences or side effects, and if one belongs to a non-vulnerable demographic, then the decision to delay the vaccine shot as much as possible is perfectly rational.

Important to note that the vaccines don't prevent infection, they just prevent the infection from making you sick. Thus, the argument could be made that the more informed/intelligent specimens will tend to prefer delaying the shot so the dumber/less informed specimens get it first.

Não faz sentido prolongar a vida a quem foi recrutado pela morte por determinação exclusiva da sua própria biologia e/ou vivência. Quem tem de morrer tem de morrer.

There's a big difference between fantasy and intent, and in a way it sounds like he was trying to open up to you, expose all his demons - however troubling, and thus build intimacy and perhaps even get your help.

To be clear - I wasn't there so I don't know what tones or expressions he used. You say you had a good relationship so far, so he mist not be a total creep and knows you well enough to realize nothing good would happen if he told you about it (e.g. a threesome, like some comments here suggested). It really sounds like he was just trying to open up. You can criticize him for not keeping these things to himself (or having that ""fetish"" to begin with), and you wouldn't necessarily be wrong. Breaking up with him is of course your decision, though you should know many people, men and women, that are in very good, healthy relationships, have fetishes that they would never act upon or fulfil and would alarm the fuck out of their partners if they ever shared them. They just decide not to. Your bf decided you deserve to know. 
As for telling her mom in order to ""defend her"" - excuse my unpopular opinion but this is a huge exaggeration, and that's a euphemism. Again, you know him. You were comfortable enough to move in with him. So you really think she needs defending? Fantasy != intent. Unlike your scarring age-difference relationship, he doesn't want to have a relationship with her. He's with you, and seems pretty intent on staying with you, ain't he? Your (possibly ex by now) bf decides to open up to you and in return you break up with him and destroy his relationship with his friend because you have your own scars and insecurities? I'm sorry but that's not only unfair, its selfish, no matter how you try to frame it to make it sound like you care about her. His friend and wife are going to overreact, as any parent would, especially seeing that I'm assuming you won't be using any euphemisms when telling them, and your bf, who just wanted to be completely honest with you about something he and anyone else have no control over, would be severely punished.

The way you picture him presenting it, seems he's already aware this is wrong and not in line with social norms, he may even be ashamed of it and trying ro cope with the guilt over a feeling that, again, he cannot consciously control. Don't you think speaking to him and explaining why you're so ""disgusted"" and how you tie that to your past relationship would help him understand and thus yield better results than just ghosting and blowing up his friendship? If he truly understands how you see things he seems very likely to gradually change his mindset and the way he perceives his own out-of-bounds fantasy. 

Down vote away but I think anyone on here that suggested you react in a harsher manner before exploring other avenues is a bit of a drama queen and don't have your best interest at heart.",1595054085.0,"07/18/2020, 02:34:45",

gq0y5dr,medicine,lxyy1b,,3,0,ObviousIntroduction2,"My dated experience:

I entered med school in 1999, got the scholarship in 2000, for 3 years. The cash value of the scholarship was \~$160K and I left school with $60K debt(took out $20K as a house down payment prior to finishing). 

I did IM. The choice of positions available my year was lean but I was flexible going into the decision. My partner was also aware that we would be moving, likely to a isolated/rural community. I ended up working for the IHS in AZ. I chose the IHS as I wanted a ""system"" and didn't want to have to scramble for my patients to see subspecialties. 

I was paid the same as the other physicians working for the IHS and my work hours were also the same. I made about the same there as I would have if I had stayed in the city were I did my residency(started at $110K and finished at $160K, 2006-2009)

I had to fill out paperwork every 6 months, that stated that I worked the appropriate hours, in direct patient care. Easy enough to do. 

Important things to consider: Do you really want to do primary care? You can go on to fellowship, no problem, but there is the opportunity cost. Also, are you flexible with where you could be for a few years? I thought the IHS was an incredible experience and would recommend everyone do it. 3 years of a post-doc fellowship in primary care/rural medicine cannot be beat.

hk84r58,medicine,qr33io,Salty-Particular,3,0,am_i_wrong_dude,"The rest of this subthread devolved into personal fighting over a misunderstanding.

1. /u/TheMedicalHistorian is saying that patients and other staff use the ""accent"" excuse for justifying a change in doctor when the real reason is skin color / surface cultural signifiers. The personal experience that this user is citing is that he or she is a native speaker and is still asked to defer to whiter doctors. He or she could have been more explicit, but feeling defensive when others chime in to insist the user must indeed have an accent is understandable.

2. Discussions of differential treatment and outcomes in medicine by reported racial background have a history of being difficult here and elsewhere. One suggestion is rather than trying to figure out who is the malicious racist (often none of our colleagues are acting with overt racist intents), consider acknowledging the problem and working toward educational and policy outcomes that mitigate the problematic behavior and outcome. Calling each other ""racist"" back and forth achieves very little and poisons the discourse on our good-faith professional discussion platform.

/r/medicine is not a general question and answer subreddit. It exists to foster conversations among medical professionals, not to answer questions about medicine from the general public. Do not post questions of the ""askreddit"" variety. This includes questions about medical conditions, prognosis, medications, careers, or other medical topics.

A list of medical subreddits, including those friendly to general questions, can be found at /r/medicine/wiki/index.

And ""masculine leader"" is also wearing thin, especially as the world is finding a new future, a ""multiple-one"" not easily guessed at from the past... ""Chasing them"" also seems to be quasi-universal and eternal... but which again is also wearing thin. Ye Olde Yin is becoming Yang, and Ye Olde Yang is becoming Yin... *rapidly!*

BTW Lao Tzu wrote that about 2500 years ago, about old yin and old yang. But there is at least one wrinkle that he perhaps overlooked. In ""Modern China"", when old yin becomes yang and old yang becomes yin, they... they don't ever seem to become ""young"" again! Old yin becomes middle aged yang, and old yang becomes middle aged yin, *both* smack dab in the middle of Ye Olde Mid-Life Crisis! This is what is happening today: our women and our men are switching places! Sort of... And switching smack dab into the middle of a huge, dinosaur extinguishing Universal if not Eternal Mid-Life Crisis! We need to start thinking about changing Lao Tzu's recipe to at least include the *possibility* of Old Yin becoming *Young* Yang instead of Mid-Life Crisis Yang, and counter-pointedly for Old Yang. (Trickster! Where are you now that we *need* you!)

I also remember reading a story about the wife of a ""perfect husband who did everything right"", including always showing her that he ""desired"" her. Except that she felt that after many years (and some children) his desire for her was like ye olde kiss on the cheek upon going out the door heading for work in the morning. So she she found the desire with the aliveness that she craved by hooking up with multiple guys in bars, guys who *seriously* if not truly ""*desired*"" her, if only from the time the bar closed until she left for home at 4AM.

Uhhh... All the best *everyone!* Com Deus...",1634356301.0,"10/15/2021, 23:51:41",

also, they didn’t want to diagnose me. my foreign parents didn’t understand it and didn’t want their daughter to have a label, and my psychiatrist was scared it would be a label that will cause a lot of stress on me and i may not even have it when im older. they only decided to diagnose me once they found me in a hospital bed after trying to commit suicide, because that way i was actually presenting my symptoms to people. before that i was struggling on my own which was hard enough, and if i did actually end up dead, no one would have known i had bpd. also, i don’t live in the USA (i live in the UK) but 1% out of the american population is still a lot. 

also, i’m pretty sure im younger than you and maybe my opinion is ‘incorrect’ because im a teenager and part of the generation everyone hates but as someone who was diagnosed with PDD depression and BPD, the ONLY reason i’ve ever actually mentioned is because it isn’t a stigma online if that makes sense, i know other people have it and it’s not only me. it’s made me more comfortable to come out and talk about my struggles. i know that some people do it as a trend, but honestly, it’s like another other problem (struggles of being an LGBT citizen, being sexually harassed, etc) that more people are talking about so it seems like a trend. i have had SO MANY people tell me that i don’t actually have bpd, but when i actually pull out the dozen of forms and tests, they eventually believe me. do u want people on the internet to do that? have to show the world personal documents just so people believe them?

i get where ur coming from but sometimes people need to understand that yes, some people (even tho it’s rare) under the age of 18 can get a diagnosis. my school struggled to believe me let alone people online. people really need to understand that circumstances differ, i have never personally seen anymore glamorise the symptoms of bpd (what would they glamorise? the mood swings, attachment issues or self-harming behaviour?) being diagnosed let’s me know that im not going crazy, that what im doing is just wired in my brain and i can’t stop it. i already suffered enough not having a diagnosis, and now people are telling me my diagnosis doesn’t exist. 

this went besides the point and turned into a rant and i also despise the people who fake having bpd and romanticise it because it feels like a living hell inside of my head but we need to know the majority don’t, only people on the internet not actual life.",1636006551.0,"11/04/2021, 02:15:51",

1: Yes so far we have tested the methodology here for oral and throat cancers at various stages.

We have tested a device on prostate, oesophageal and cervical cancer but only biopsies so far with promising results.
2: You are exactly right! Cancer is not straight forward (as a physicist I found this out the hard way). The device uses many biomarkers which are found to be specific for each cancer (ie the key biomarkers change for each cancer) to detect/predict the progression of the cancer.

Thanks for the reply I really do appreciate it! I am actually in talks with pathologists and surgeons (who seem to really like the idea of instant results during examinations). I must admit it is quite possible I am using some of the terms somewhat clumsily, I only have experience in medical/biological in the oral area where I work with a relatively small number of clinicians and life scientists. What I mean by prognosis 
(I could be misunderstood) is that after training my MLA I am able to predict the future development and characteristics of the cancers (such as how aggressive they are, how they may progress and how likely they are to spread). I can compare the MLA predictions to the known outcomes of the patients the biopsies where taken from. As for the other markers I must claim ignorance that they are out of my wheel house. To be clear this is a technique which is still very early in development and certainly isn't a 1 size fits all machine and I envision it be a tool to be used along side existing methods where I believe it can give addition information than  is currently available. We have had very promising results from the cancers we have tried so far, oral, oesophageal, cervical, prostate. It is quite possible that this device is not appropriate for all cancers, in fact I would bet that it isn't. But these are the type of conversations I need to have, and I really do appreciate the help, I still think too like a physicist and I don't what to fall into the trap of assuming what medical professionals would like.",1599684023.0,"09/09/2020, 16:40:23",

Now I will have to admit that some of what you have said there has gone over my head. Some of the points you made I am familiar with, such as a b c e f, which at least for the case of oral/head and neck we have been able to test and the clinicians I work with are happy with the predictive strength my device has shown.

g1cajvo,Oncology,i8nynx,fintasticallyfast_,2,0,fintasticallyfast_,"Thanks for your reply. Geographically, eBL, Malaria, and EBV overlap very heavily in certain tropical regions, including sub-Saharan Africa. In a study recently published ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30457091/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30457091/)), the EMBLEM team found that regions with high eBL incidence experience consistent year round levels of malaria positivity from ages 0-15. However, not everyone who gets both EBV and Malaria develops eBL, indicating that there are other unknown risk factors present needed to explain this territorial overlap. Our findings indicating that children who are asymptomatic and do not express extreme immune responses to long term malaria exposure, exhibit a risk factor not previously known that could explain this geographic overlap. The EMBLEM team is also researching genetic risk factors and Malaria/EBV variants in relationship to eBL incidence to see if they are unknown cofactors and explain this territorial overlap.",1597335476.0,"08/13/2020, 12:17:56",

However, our research was part of the Epidemiology of Burkitt lymphoma in East African children and minors (EMBLEM) study which focuses on Burkitt Lymphoma in endemic regions of sub Saharan Africa. One of the goals of our study is to look at risk factors in regions endemic to Burkitt Lymphoma, and our findings indicating long term low grade malaria infection is a catalyst for Burkitt Lymphoma development, creates testable hypotheses that can be pursued in future analytical studies.

gsi19qs,sports,meksc0,Texas-Troubadour,6,0,TheGrrrrr,"I’ll try to clarify.  Your suggestion that Men’s Basketball generates more revenue and therefore should have a higher budget makes sense in a business sense.  Capitalism at work.  Unfortunately Capitalism leaves gaps in funding and services that society needs because those endeavors are inherently unprofitable.   Society fills this gaps by providing incentives (tax breaks and other benefits) to entities that governments (a function of those societies) have classified as not-for-profit.  It generally work fairly well, until those not-for-profit entities start behaving like businesses and the funding and services gets shifting to generating profits.  Certainly not-for-profits must raise funds, but those funds are supposed to primarily go to the unprofitable endeavors, thereby filling that gap.  If the NCAA wants to fund the profitable elements of its endeavors above the unprofitable elements, it and the institutions that are benefiting from those revenues are operating as a business and should not have the benefits of not-for-profit status.  If the profit motive is rightly removed from budgeting decisions then the unequal funding becomes a decision based on gender, which is illegal.  So either the NCAA and the Schools should have their not-for-profit status revoked or they should fund their endeavors equally with regard to gender, when the endeavors are essentially the same in function ie. both in this case are basketball championship tournaments.  If it were basketball vs field hockey, funding differences would be attributable to factors other than gender.  Either, way, the not-for-profit status is at the crux of the issue, because the overall goal is supposed to be funding and serving endeavors that capitalism does not.  This explanation is in no way an argument against capitalism or the not-for-profit system which generally complement each other well when not abused.",1616875637.0,"03/27/2021, 16:07:17",

 I miss her alot too daily, but the hardness of her sickness  worried me so much. When she was sick, those were the days that Taliban wanted to attack from that side to my city. My mother oxygen was really low and she was suffering alot. I was really afraid that if they attacked in that hospital, doctors would escape and what would happen to my mother and other patients. My mother was crying because she heard that doctors were talking about Taliban' coming in covid hospital. I never forget those dark days, but I always tried to be strong.
