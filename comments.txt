I cant add anything to this except to say you are 100% spot on. 

In my field (emergency) - as a resident, my ED shifts we had a single attending with a senior and a junior resident covering roughly 25 beds or so. 

When we had our mandatory conference time (which was conveniently the least busy day of the week) and the residents could not work clinically, those same 25 beds required two attendings AND an APP. 

Even adding in over testing as a resident there is no way that two residents were more costly than another attending and an APP. Just no fing way. 

Add in that Medicare was giving my institution $100k/yr or more and I was only seeing less than half just no fing way.

The President certainly had MORE medical care than anyone else, but the question of better is very much in doubt. The experimental Regeneron treatments could have been harmful for all his idiot doctors knew. Treatments remain experimental until enough data exists to support their use in a clinical setting. 

He was lucky enough that it didnt seem to cause him harm but more =/= better!

Don't APOLOGIZE. Apologizing implies you are somehow taking ownership of the wait time, which you do not control. You thank the patient for their patience, which IS something they control. In addition apologizing turns you, the physician (or nurse, or tech, or person providing a needed service), into a supplicant. You are not the supplicant. The patient is the supplicant, asking for care. This reversal of power roles can sometimes embolden the worst assholes into thinking that somehow you ARE the equivalent of the Walmart cashier and are an appropriate vessel for their abuse. Thanking the patient for their patience maintains the appropriate power dynamic.

The "biden has dementia" angle is pretty obviously a Russian planted propaganda piece. Where you first read it or where it was posted most often is not great evidence that Sanders supporters (or other progressives in general) agree with that statement.

As a very left leaning progressive I detest the "biden has dementia" bullshit line or the "biden is a pedophile" line. Both of these statements are demonstrably false. I do however have issues with his -policies- not moving the needle enough with regards to climate change or social equality among other issues.

He has lied greater than 20,000 times since becoming president. This does not give me high confidence in his independent statements. The timing of this is also highly suspect - 10 days of quarantine seems plenty of time to allow his abysmal debate performance to pass from the scrutiny of the public eye, and testing positive will endear some sympathy from swing state voters, particularly suburban women (a demographic that his debate debacle hurt him with). 

I don't believe almost anything he says until I hear it from independent sources as well.

I haven't stated in any of my posts that I argue/block/talk down to my psychiatry physician colleagues. If a psychiatrist calls me on an inpatient psych patient they are sending to my ED for any reason, my response is always "send them over, we'll assess and take care of them". 

Also, when I have a psych patient on a mental health hold and the -psychiatrist- refuses transfer due to medical concerns, I'm happy to discuss with them. While I can't promise I'll change management due to their concerns, I'll certainly have a collegial discussion with them. If you called me on that tachycardic/SOB potential PE I'd have taken them back in a heartbeat for additional medical assessment. Likewise the patient with DT's - you know as well as I do that time since last drink is a determining factor for developing DT's, and while they may have looked OK during their first assessment in the ED, they can go into florid withdrawals at any time. 

Malingering CP patients gonna malinger though. Sometimes they tell me about their chest pain, sometimes they wait until they're in the psych ward. If I believe them they don't immediately go to the psych ward, they get a cardiac/resp workup and only once it's negative do I state they are "medically cleared" - a statement I always clarify in the chart as the "patient is currently considered medically stable for discharge home and appropriate for psychiatric disposition" (love my dragon macro's).

I have a feeling you and I would get along smashingly if we worked in nearby institutions. We agree on nearly every major point.
-------------------------------
1 : 2019-10-15
This! Glad to see I am not the only one who experiences this immensely frustrating interaction on an all-too-frequent basis. 

Where I immediately lose my shit is when I get the message from my staff that the psych charge RN 'won't accept that patient until you fix that BP of 160/90 (or the calcium of 8.2, or the K of 3.1, or the "UTI" that isn't, or the WBC of 16, or whatever other silly clinically irrelevant thing they've decided is out of their scope of practice)'

These are issues that should be discussed with the attending psychiatrist before the RN refuses the transfer. Having the psych RN call my staff and dictate through them things that I should do in the ER before they'll accept the transfer is wildly inappropriate. 

The easiest course of action of course is to make a dog-and-pony show of fixing an issue before they refuse the transfer. But that's wrong, and even in this day and age of HCAHPS and PG scores and being 'written up' I still practice medicine the way that I believe is right for my patients.
-------------------------------
1 : 2019-10-14
The majority of an ER Docs M&amp;Ms are *hiding in his/her psych patients. I agree. I also know mistakes happen. 

If the psychiatrist disagrees with my medical clearance then they can give me a call. Id be happy to discuss it with them. Hell Ill probably give them the benefit of the doubt. While you understand that I know Im not smarter than every doctor on the planet, when it comes to a patient Ive already seen and the psychiatrist hasnt, I guarantee Im smarter than them with regards to their medical care. Not being egoistic here either, just real talk. 

I will not, now or ever, accept a nurse admin dictating MEDICAL patient care for someone they havent seen and I have already cleared of medical emergencies.

Someplace else, I suppose. Or board in the ER for a week, right? Because thats a totally humane thing to force onto our acutely psychotic patients who are too sick for the psych hospital.

1 : 2019-10-14
I do the dressing down when a nurse admin who hasnt even seen the patient demands a course of treatment for a nonexistent problem, holding the patients true treatment (of their psych illness) hostage as a threat. 

Thats practicing medicine without a license. Like I said before - i am immediately furious on this issue, and its entirely justifiable.
-------------------------------
1 : 2019-10-14
I guess I should add - in my state psych patients get diverted to the ER for medical clearance, a magical phrase that means exactly nothing. So if I have a depressed and stable suicidal patient and I want them to actually get the help they need from an inpatient psych ward, I am required to send garbage labs. Which I do. And I then am required to make a statement in the chart that contains the magical words medically cleared. Which I do. 

And I -still- run into these types of issues.

Edited to add: if I state a patient is medically cleared, why is a nurse admin blocking a psych transfer because of a silly lab value thats not within range? Or a uti that isnt? Or, and I swear that this is a real thing that actually happened, refusing a transfer because a patient had a high wbc (of 16) and asking me to give antibiotics? 

No, Karen, the WBC is not high because of infection. The patient has been on a meth bender for a month and was brought here by police after being found naked at the gas station. Of course her WBC is high. Its demargination. 

Medically cleared means Ive actually examined the patient and they dont have a medical emergency other than their psych diagnosis. Please just trust me on that.
-------------------------------
1 : 2019-10-14
You handled that well. 

I usually dont have -too- many issues where I work with the actual psychiatrists being unreasonable in terms of accepting patients to the psych hospital. The asymptomatic HTN patient, the this guy was hypoxic (but only while sleeping and he has OSA so just give him his nasal CPAP), etc. 

Where I immediately see red is when a psych facility refuses a transfer due to some clinically irrelevant laboratory value on bloodwork that they MADE ME GET and I hear from my staff that oh you just need to give them calcium and theyll accept that patient and I call to speak to the psychiatrist to hash out why the serum calcium of 8.3 is totally fine and I find out that there is no psychiatrist there. That the patient is being refused by the psych hospital charge nurse.  

Immediate fury. 

Ive dressed down a few of these people by asking them what state their medical license is active in so I can look them up.

Ill assume your comment is serious and not an attempt to troll.

I dont prescribe oxy for 3/10 pain and most reasonable patients dont ask for 2 weeks off. The average ED patient is totally competent to make an informed decision regarding how sick they feel and how much work related BS theyll deal with while feeling that sick. 

Look, Im not in the business of policing patients. While Ill work with a cold or mild musculoskeletal pain (and indeed have worked situations where Id probably be better off recuperating in bed), Im not going to force a food service worker or a factory worker or an office temp to work with a cold. Either they get paid with pto or they dont. Either way its no skin off my nose. Id actually much rather that these people didnt need a doctors note in the first place. What an insulting requirement from an employer!
-------------------------------
47 : 2019-06-03
As an ER doctor, I never deny a work-off request. Im thankful I dont need to approve or disapprove disability requests. 
My opinion is that one of two situations is present. First situation, the patient has PTO they can use to fund the day off, in which case it would be stupid of them to NOT use a sick day or three when they feel they need it. Second situation, the patient doesnt get paid for days they dont work. What do I care in that situation? 

Its a weird thing to ask physicians to choose who is too sick to work. Presuming that we are all adults, we can make intelligent decisions about how sick we really are. 

I have too much to track otherwise. Ive never refused a sick day request and dont plan to at any point.

First off, police are not subject to HIPAA. 

Secondly, clinical status (I.e., critical condition, stable condition, deceased, in our intensive care unit,etc) is not PHI (protected health information) even if the police WERE subject to HIPAA. 

How else do you think the news reports on that stuff? 

I hope this is fake but dont rely on information regarding someone dying proving this is fake. Far from it. 

The police would need to know about someone dying anyway, as it upgrades potential charges (from assault to homicide). 

Source: I am a doctor.
-------------------------------
55 : 2019-05-14
Came here to say this is not a HIPAA violation at all. Also I'd argue it's not even a boundary to cross this line. I'll often google the names of very sick patients I transfer out to tertiary care centers. If their obituary doesn't show up in a month or so I tell myself they made it. If I see their obituary it isn't like I'm surprised. Much easier and actually less likely to raise eyebrows with the clipboard nurses than calling the transfer centers and asking questions is. 

I'll also sometimes google the names of my frequent fliers when I haven't seen them in a while. Usually it's because they moved, but occasionally it's because they died.

Your dad probably had both the rabies vaccine series (now a single shot at day 0, 3, 7, and 14 after exposure) and rabies immunoglobulin - this is the medicine that immediately binds to the rabies virus and protects you against infection. The rabies vaccine series works through your own immune system and works well, but for someone who was exposed recently, and had a large inoculation or virus particles, its not enough.

ER perspective here. 

While the first doctors care was a bit cowboy-ish (post op roux-en-y patients with abdominal pain, bandemia, and fluid collections in the belly would IMHO equal an immediate surgical bedside consultation with admission for serial belly exams being preferable) they did at least talk to the surgeon and had somewhat of a plan. Sounds like they were blaming the pain on the cellulitis/skin abscess alone. Still, the doc dictated their concerns about the right sided pain and the I&amp;D was left sided. I wouldnt have discharged her at that time but its not frank malpractice to do so. 

The second doc... Jesus. 

Thats pretty indefensible. There was obvious bias, and thats likely what killed her. 

Look, bouncebacks are usually a pain in the ass and usually theres nothing wrong that a little more patient education cant fix. This was not one of those cases. I usually expand the workup on undifferentiated bouncebacks for reasons similar to this.

I average 2.5 pt/hr and work 8 hr shifts. Most days I see between 16 and 24 in total. The days I get up to 13 or 14 active undispositioned patients are my busier ones. It means the workups have been complicated (i.e. long to complete) AND the volumes have been high.
-------------------------------

Not a primary care doc, so take this with a grain of salt. I am an ER doc with no residents and no scribe. 

My work flow generally runs like this - arrive on shift and go see between 3 and 6 new patients depending on level of acuity. Chart a little in the room (mostly dates, names, specialists, things that I will forget literally as soon as I walk out of the room) but also put in all orders while in the room and set expectations for length of stay, workup plan, etc, then swing back to my desk and take any sign-outs the leaving doc needs to tell me about. I'll dictate every chart at that time up to the MDM portion which I leave blank. I then go see another 2-3 new patients at a time, and head back to my desk to again dictate my charts - like, complete complete aside from the MDM. It's a ton of button clicking anyway, but I do dictate the HPI using dragon. 

I usually work my way up to a census of ~8-10 patients before I'm ready to start dispositioning my old patients. As SOON as I make the decision to dispo, I dictate/chart the MDM and close the chart. If I admit, I put in the admission order and that's that. If the patient is being discharged, I type d/c diagnosis and type the d/c instructions and scripts, and that's that. 

I try to cap my census at about 14 or so, and truly critical patients tend to throw a monkey wrench into the smoothness of this operation, but generally I'm not more than 2-3 FULL notes behind. As my shift is winding down I do my best to focus more on dispo's than on picking up new patients. I may have between 6 and 10 MDM/dispositions to make the last hour or so of my shift. 

I usually leave mostly on time - then again I consider leaving within 30 minutes of the end of my shift totally on time. I don't chart at home, I make sure to close out my charts before I leave. This way the time I do spend at home I am not mentally somewhere else. 

Do you type your charts? Maybe invest in Dragon. You'd be shocked how quickly you can dictate a paragraph long HPI once you are proficient in it.

In my experience MLPs are slowly making inroads to all specialties aside from radiology, but even radiology is threatened by computer algorithms that are being developed. Extenders are needed because there is simply too much work to be done completely by physicians alone. This is in large part because residency programs are funded by CMS and numbers of graduating residents change very slowly because of it.

Compensation is impossible to predict for any specialty. So much of compensation depends on CMS, and that's as easy to predict as the stock market. 

Job security is the one thing I don't think any physician legitimately has to worry about. There will always be work for those who aren't complete a-holes or incompetent (and there's work for some of those, too). How much you are getting paid for said work, however...

EMTs are great and all, but they cant confirm it was a seizure.

Only thing that can truly confirm that is EEG monitoring DURING the event. 

It sounds like your ex had lido with epi. The dentist probably hit the nerve and artery bundle, the epi vasoconstricted the artery causing half his face to turn yellow (poor arterial blood flow leads to yellowish tinge to the skin), he had intense pain due to the nerve being hit and he syncopized/fainted. While unconscious he had twitching and shaking that looked like a seizure. 

Sorry that happened. Seizures in non-epileptics during the situation you described are incredibly rare. Syncope and vasoconstriction? Super common.

When I started this journey, I had a -plan-. I used happyscale and it gave me the exact date I'd hit my goal weight and also allowed me to calculate mini-goals along the way. As I've gotten closer to my goal weight, my timeframe has become a lot more flexible. I don't have a definite timeframe on when I want to hit 170, but I've got a general idea. As in, plus or minus 6 months or so. 

It's not like anything magical will happen when I hit 170. I'll be able to eat a little more (maintenance) and then I can start a bulk cycle and work on raising my lifts. But that's all that will change. 

I'll still be counting calories. I'll still struggle to avoid eating grapes on the counter all day long. I'll still say "no thanks" to the brownies someone baked and brought into work. I'll still be weighing myself regularly - ideally, daily. 

Nearly 4 decades of living in this body has taught me that I can't trust myself to eat using internal hunger cues. That's what made me fat. 

&gt;How can I be patient and accept that the last ten might take many months?

Where are you going in such a hurry? You'll get there. There's something to be said for taking some time so the new good habits stick.

Multivitamins are not harmful.

There isn't any evidence that they are and stating that they -could- be is a sneaky way to tell a lie.

The worst harm that could possibly happen is that you spend a few bucks a month on something you don't strictly need. The only vitamins you can reasonably 'OD' on are the fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) - and you would need to take waaaaaaay more than a single multivitamin a day to achieve the doses necessary.

When calorie restricting a lot of people eat (for instance) way fewer carbs (and stop eating cereals supplemented with everything) OR they cut out cheese and butter OR stop eating red meat. In these scenarios it's very easy to be low on some vital micronutrient. 

But that's fine, you do you. It's obviously working! 
-------------------------------
0 : 2017-08-29
I'd agree with most of what you wrote. How to get started losing weight is good advice. 

I disagree with the advice to not use vitamins or supplements. A daily multivitamin, while probably not necessary for everyone, can be helpful when restricting calories. It's not that hard to miss some of your micronutrients on a calorie deficit and a multivitamin helps you hit your calcium and iron goals in particular.
Protein shakes can be very filling options as an alternative to breakfast, also.

I ageee creatinine is a bad idea on a deficit. It leads to water retention and can increase the number on the scale. It's much more helpful when bulking. 

I also applaud OP for lifting on a deficit. It has been SO helpful for me. It's harder to gain muscle mass on a deficit (not impossible for newbie lifters who are overfat, as opposed to the popular broscience about this) but it has really helped with how I feel about my body. It's never too early to think about body recomposition. 

I'd suggest to check out the sidebar on loseit and on /r/fitness also.

Lots of good advice here. 
As an ER doctor I work occasional nights, late swing shifts, early swing shifts, and even early day shifts. My schedule is all over the place. You're right, it makes working out hard. But it's not impossible.

Since your schedule is predictable I'd suggest you just stay on a night schedule during your time off. Make sleeping from 9:00A - 5:00P your 'anchor' and plan your workouts, meals, and sex life around this. 

There's another post here about making your bedroom dark - agree 100%. I don't use trash bags but I have used aluminum foil taped over the windows in the past. I'd also suggest cold af and use a noise machine too. 

If you don't have a predictable schedule or if you HAVE to switch to days (kids are really the only completely rigid reason I can imagine of) it makes this infinitely harder.  

My workaround is the day I need to switch -back to days- is what I call a DOMA (day off? My ass). I come home, sleep 4 hours AT MOST, and then drag my butt out of bed and go do something outside. Soak up the sunshine and force your pineal gland to recognize the reality. Then it's to bed by 7:00 or 8:00 PM (maybe with a dose of melatonin) and I'm ready to go the next day. Good luck.

There is a maximum amount the normal human body can process in a single day, but the amount of calories is ungodly high, like in the range of 20,000 kcal a day. This assumes a relatively balanced intake of carbs, fats, and protein. You can't expect to drink a liter of olive oil and absorb it all. But a jar of peanut butter, a cheesecake, a slab of fatty ham? Sure. 

Our physiologies are designed for feast and famine conditions (similar to most carnivorous or omnivorous animals). This is WHY we store fat so damn efficiently.

High protein meals have a lot of inherent advantages. They keep you feeling full a lot longer than carb heavy meals. They're essential for minimizing the loss of muscle mass while on a calorie deficit (but only in combination with resistance training). 

Is your flair weight in pounds or kilograms? If it's in pounds, that goal weight puts you at a BMI of 19.5. Yes it's 'normal' but that's a harsh cut to drop from a BMI of 22 to 19.5. Maybe up your goal a few hundred calories a day? I've found that helps. When I'm eating 1800 cal/day, I'm miserable. At 2,000 I'm way more satisfied. It's not like this adjustment is making my weight loss take considerably longer, and I'm much more likely to not cave and binge when I'm satisfied.

This is awesome that you were able to have the work done. However, I will caution anyone thinking about having this done out of country that your FOLLOW-UP is going to be damn near impossible. Complications from major surgery are the rule, not the exception.

My thinking on this may have been a bit backwards. I did end up picking a goal weight kind of in the middle of a healthy BMI for my height, but I got to this number by backing into it. 

What I did was figure out a caloric goal for my height and activity level that I knew internally was totally sustainable for the rest of my life, and then calculated the weight I would be if I was eating at that maintenance level. If you're interested, the calorie budget is 2700 cal/day. Enough for 3 hearty meals, dessert, and a beer or two every day. 

I plan on a cycle of bulk and cut after I hit 170 similar to /u/ificandoit. This bulk cycle will be a surplus of 200 cal a day, the cut will be a deficit of 500 cal a day.

I've been cutting weight while lifting for 6 months now and my progress on my lifts has finally stalled. I have realized I will not lift any heavier things while eating at a serious caloric deficit no matter how much protein I eat. So, I'm looking forward to being able to eat at a (small) surplus to gain extra muscle. 

I'll get that 4 plate deadlift yet! 
-------------------------------
1 : 2017-07-16
I eat about 170-200 g of protein a day on a 2000 cal/day "diet". I lift 5 days a week. After cutting for 6 months my lifts have only now within the last 3 weeks started to stall. I'm not going to gain much in strength the rest of my cut (about 60 more pounds, so more than halfway there!) but the high protein plus regular lifting will help me avoid too much loss of lean body mass. 

Keep doing what you're doing. 0.8 to 1.0 g a day of *protein per kg of* ideal lean body mass is plenty to keep you from losing LBM while on a cut, but don't cut your calories too fast or you'll lose some LBM anyway (no matter how high your protein is). Check out r/fitness, this question is posed there frequently. Read the FAQ there too. Chock full of good info.

So sorry for your loss. It's good that you turned something horrible into something positive, but oof, what a rough start. Hope you're doing ok.

Years and years I've wanted to lose weight. Yet this past January some other things in my life seemed to be clicking (financials finally getting in order, family settling in after a cross country move, relationship with my wife improving because most of all I was finally treating my depression) and I was still unhappy with myself. I was happy with all these other things, but unhappy with myself. 

It's like, I have all these external trappings of success but I felt like a total failure because I couldn't even master my own freaking body. 

I think treating my depression helped a lot. Something just clicked. Didn't want to be unhappy any more. So I started counting calories. 
-------------------------------
4 : 2017-07-11
Started this cut at 6' and ~310 lbs in January so I had a lot of extra fat. A lot. 

My lifts have just started to stall this month after losing ~ 80 lbs. 

My 1RM's are Bench 265 lbs, Squat 335 lbs, DL 400 lbs, and OHP 160 lbs. 

I'm eating ~ 160-200 g of protein a day and doing n-suns 5/3/1. 

In short, I progressed a lot longer than I thought I would. 

Still lifting and still cutting. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2017-07-11
If I'm right, it's probably pectus excavatum. "Pigeon chest". 

His chest looks something like that because he still has extra fat, and has a lot of extra skin. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2017-07-11
Your doctor has a defeatist attitude because he's seen a lot of his patients 'try' and fail to lose weight. 

Just because most people can't do it doesn't mean you can't. The real reason most people fail to lose weight is that they are 'trying' all wrong. Not measuring portions, not counting every bite, not even counting calories at all! All rookie mistakes. Read the FAQ and enlighten yourself and you will not make these rookie mistakes. 

Count your calories and stick to a daily deficit and you WILL lose weight. Low T, hypothyroid, it does not matter. Calories are a unit of measurement of energy. Your physiology is not alien. Your body is the same as everyone else's. 

In other words, you are not a special snowflake when it comes to weight loss. 

Your doctor sounds pretty negative. I'd encourage you to see someone else.

"Why did I ever think that being fit is only for attracting women? Why didnt I think that my wife also deserved the best version of me?"

How true this is. 

Staying attractive for your spouse is important to keep the relationship positive.

What a horrible thing to say. 

Check out /r/raisedbynarcissists. My mom is very similar to yours except mine is fat. 

Keep being awesome in spite of her. 
-------------------------------
6 : 2017-07-06
Best: Random "You are AWESOME!" from my wife after putting her arms around me.

Worst: "Yeah, your father lost and gained a lot of weight before he died, too." from my mother. I was so mad I made my own thread about it (check my comment history). 
-------------------------------
4 : 2017-07-06
Awesome! Super inspiring. The addition of making sure you're eating adequate protein is SUCH a game changer. I've been doing this also - aiming for 0.8-1 g/lb of lean body mass a day - and I'm not hungry like I used to be. Keep up the good work! 
-------------------------------
2 : 2017-06-26
Very noticeable difference. You look great. Keep it up!

If it's becoming a slog you might want to increase your calories. Bumping to 1500 a day means you take a few more weeks to get to goal weight. Who cares if it takes longer? You've got your whole life ahead of you. 
-------------------------------
2 : 2017-06-24
I'm always shocked by the fact that these negative comments made behind your back are
A) not directly addressed by your so called friends and
B) relayed to you so that you can obsess over them

Regardless of the fact that this female coworker is a turd of a human being (she is), your coworkers have some growing up to do.

Do you have a food scale? If you are not weighing your food before you consume it, you're likely underestimating how many calories it has. 
-------------------------------
2 : 2017-06-23
Hey dude, I always love reading your posts here. You're a major inspiration for me. 

Keep up with your weight loss. You and I together. We'll get there. Despite our shitty moms. 
-------------------------------
2 : 2017-06-23
Her twisted reasoning probably worked out just that way. Or maybe she didn't have any real reason to say it. 

One thing I do know - with my mother it is ALWAYS about her. No conversation lingers on anything else for longer than two sentences. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2017-06-23
Thanks. 

She's the only parental figure I have left. Sometimes I wish my father and her could switch places. Life's not fair, y'know?
-------------------------------
6 : 2017-06-23
I gray rocked my mom before I knew what a gray rock was. :D

Usually I don't rise to the bait. But this time was... I don't know. I've lost 70 pounds! People I work with are ALL over it. EVERY other person I saw on this trip - the first thing they said was 'wow! You look great!' or some variation of the same. 

And my mom... oof. Just oof. 

I lost my frame and allowed myself to respond. 
-------------------------------
8 : 2017-06-23
Thanks. She really made me mad at the time. Now that I have some distance (time and physical) I'm able to see it for what it was - just my mom being my mom. She won't change. I can't expect a healthy relationship with her. 
-------------------------------
23 : 2017-06-23
The more I think about it the more I realize that her statement was not at all about me. It was about her and her poisoned mind. 

No one is the villain in their own life story, right? 

Anyway, I'm using it as added motivation. 
-------------------------------
4 : 2017-06-23
I can relate with the 'always making it about her', sadly. 
I moved far away from my own mother but I still visit occasionally. I'll have to limit my contact with her again I think. 

I have to stop framing this as discouraging. It should be a source of motivation for me.

Yep.

This is an enormous compliment. It may be hard to, but -take it- as a compliment. These people look up(!) to you. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2017-06-14
Good on you for starting back up. 

I've done this once before too. Like you, I also stopped just because... no good reason why. I've looked over my old logs and I saw I was eating at a HUGE deficit. Maybe I just burned myself out. Whatever. 

It's hard to start back up, but this weight loss thing has an inertia all it's own. Once you're rolling it's hard to stop. Once you're stopped it's hard to get going again. So in a sense you're past the hard part - the starting up again. 

Keep at it. I'm proud of ya. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2017-06-09
I work nights and days too. It's a challenge. My preferred schedule is to work out BEFORE I go to work, but honestly it's all about consistency. 

Make sure your bedroom is dark (buy blackout curtains or go trailer park ghetto and put aluminum foil on the inside of the windows) and cold so you can actually sleep during the day. 

I track my calories and macros from 'out of bed' to 'into bed' - so that means my first night shift I'm always hungry. This is ok. Helps me stay awake. Satiated means sleepy and that's not good when they're paying me to be awake. 
-------------------------------
5 : 2017-06-09
Is /r/latestagecapitalism leaking? :D

Agree about the consumerist mentality. It's just so striking when you survey a magazine stand and EVERY COVER has some weight loss advertisement. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2017-06-09
Daily, first thing in the morning after peeing. I'm also using Happy Scale to chart trendlines so it's ok if I have a few days where my weight doesn't budge or even bumps. I'm less concerned about those. 

The reason I weigh daily is that EVENTUALLY I'm not going to be on a cut anymore and you only need two things to calculate your ACTUAL TDEE - consumed calories and weight fluctuations. I've got my consumed calories logged in MFP but if I was weighing only once a week the possible water weight fluctuations would screw up my data. 
-------------------------------
2 : 2017-06-09
+1 for the Happy Scale app. It not only does this, but it allows you to break down your weight loss into 'milestones' that allow you to mark your journey with mini victories. It not only fits a trend line, the trend line accounts for your recent weight loss alone. It's great. Plus it allows you to see where you'll be in a week, a month, by some future date, when you'll hit goal... All sorts of useful info for a free app. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2017-06-09
What a great reply. An upvote alone doesn't do it justice. I agree so much with all of what you wrote.

[Visceral fat is the hard stuff.](http://www.diabetes.co.uk/body/visceral-fat.html)

So congratulations! You're successfully burning visceral fat! What's left is the subcutaneous fat which is a lot 'squishier'. -That- stuff tends to hold on until you're at a much lower body fat percentage. 


-------------------------------
3 : 2017-06-09
This time around I'm doing this for myself. 

Once before I managed to lose a lot of weight with my wife. We were doing it together and she was a huge help in giving me the motivation to start and the dedication to continue. In fact I'm now within striking distance of my previous 'low'. 

However, last time I was doing the weight loss largely for her. I wasn't that uncomfortable, I still felt well. 

This time I'm doing it for entirely personal health (and vanity) reasons. Hoping to alleviate some joint pains, help with my longevity, and look good naked. 

So when it's for me, I find myself making my own decisions. I'm eating what I want, when I want. I'm lifting weights because some day I want to be proud of my body. It's allllll me.

Literally just posted a new thread about this very topic (before I saw yours!). The diet/weight loss industry is a $20,000,000,000/year monstrosity that could be largely eliminated if people could come to grips with the fact that although weight loss is HARD, it is NOT complicated.

Holy... LITERALLY TODAY I noticed that my fingernails have been looking smooth. I'm a guy, so naturally I did not notice this for months. But for the many years I was fat, my fingernails had pits and waves in them, and I just thought it was a sign of my aging. But it was obviously not. It was an outward sign of my unhealthiness that is now no longer present. So that's awesome. 
-------------------------------
26 : 2017-05-29
Avoiding the scale is one of the ways I know I'm not eating healthily. This isn't for everyone, but I think I'll need to track my weight for the rest of my life. If not daily, then at least weekly. How else will I know I'm messing up? 
-------------------------------

If your TDEE without any added exercise is 2500 cal/day, you could eat 1250 cal/day and lose 2.5 lbs a week, which would get you to 30 lbs down in 12 weeks, not 16.

If you exercise a LOT (say, a full hour of intense cardio per day), your TDEE will increase to about 3000 cal/day. This comes from increasing your EAT or exercise activity thermogenesis. You could then eat 1750 cal/day and lose 2.5 lbs a week.

"Eat at maintenance" implies you know what your TDEE is. I don't think you do know what it is based on your replies to this thread.  

Congrats on your weight loss, and hope I've cleared up some confusion. If you don't know what some of these terms or acronyms mean, it's ok to ask! 
-------------------------------

This is not precisely true with new lifters. Plenty of obese newbie lifters enjoy significant gains (like, linear progression gains) while eating at a deficit. This is not an infinite resource, though. The bit of advice you gave holds true for lifters at or near goal weight for their height. Still, there are exceptions. 
-------------------------------
3 : 2017-05-21
Don't forget fork put-downs. 
-------------------------------
2 : 2017-05-21
Eh, both are good. Low level cardio mostly increases your EAT on the day you do that exercise (exercise activity thermogenesis). HIIT increases your EAT on the day you do the exercise MOSTLY, and ALSO increases your BMR (basal metabolic rate) by increasing your lean body mass over time. Strength training mostly increases your BMR by increasing your lean body mass over time and barely touches your EAT (you may 'burn' ~100-200 cal per hour while lifting weights in EAT). 

The only form of exercise bad for your body is the one that results in injury. 
-------------------------------
2 : 2017-05-21
+1 to this.

My weight loss journey began years ago. I exercised heavily on ellipticals and began running, Even though I hated it with the fiery burning passion of a thousand suns, I did it. I was also tracking calories. Managed to get down to the 230s before I completely burned myself out. Stopped tracking calories, completely stopped exercising. 

Months later I joined Crossfit. Hated the cardio aspect of it, but loved the weight lifting aspect. I spent almost 2 years doing that and not even pretending to watch my diet. I was just spinning my wheels on the weight front, but I was getting stronger. Injuries (Crossfit!) sidelined me. I spent about 2 more years just wallowing in self pity. 

It's only been this time that I'm only doing what I love. I really enjoy lifting iron. I love mapping my progress (adding 5 lbs to my max squat is a joy each and every time it occurs). 

Just do what you enjoy. Your weight loss will occur if you keep your dietary intake under your TDEE. Cardio will help increase your TDEE as you burn extra calories on days you exercise. Strength training increases your BMR (as increasing your lean body mass over time increases your BMR). Both lead to you being able to eat more over time. 

To better understand what I mean, look at this graph.

4 : 2017-05-21
I've been lurking here for months and haven't once seen someone post "Don't exercise", or even "you won't lose weight exercising", without adding the qualifier that DIET is where weight loss occurs. You understand TDEE and you understand eating below the calories your body is burning in a day. You lost that 30 lbs by controlling your diet. 

Granted, you COULD have lost that weight without walking a single step by eating even less, but you would not have had nearly as much fun as you did by exercising. You could even have done it just as quickly. You'd be less healthy at the end of your weight loss, but the same number would show on the scale. 

I think your post is a straw man.

Ups and downs, man. Life is all ups and downs. 

So long as there are more ups than downs, it's all good.

Or, rather, more downs than ups. 
-------------------------------
14 : 2017-05-21
How true this is!! 

I strength train and just bought a bunch of new iron plates to round out my collection. I was carrying two 25 lb plates to my weight room and just walking down the stairs I was really feeling the extra weight on my knees and ankles. I carry most of my fat in my abdomen, so carrying these plates stacked in front of me was a pretty good comparison to what I used to weigh.

No f---ing wonder my feet and knees used to hurt all the time!

It makes me excited for how light on my feet I'll feel at my goal weight. 
-------------------------------
9 : 2017-05-21
For real. Everyone asks me "how do you do it?"

"... eating less." 

If they're really interested I'll get into calorie counting, planning my day out, pre-logging meals, my strength training regimen, but honestly. Most people stop at that answer. Eating less is boring. 
-------------------------------
5 : 2017-05-21
Awesome! You're an inspiration. Way to go!
-------------------------------
12 : 2017-05-20
Ate too much. 

For reals though, family habits I learned at a young age. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2017-05-20
Awesome work. You're traveling the same path I am. I started lifting first THEN got my diet under control. Did starting strength for ~5 months then simultaneously swapped to the nSuns 5/3/1 program on /r/fitness while tightening up my diet. It's a nice linear progression with some AMRAP sets thrown in. My lifts haven't stalled (yet!) and I've got that 'former fat guy' leg strength going on.  Look into that program - there are 5, 4, and even 6 day a week versions. Still, lifting while on a hard cut (I've got my diet set to ~ 1200 cal a day less than my TDEE) is HARD. Mad respect. 

You look great. Keep at it man! You're awesome!
-------------------------------
2 : 2017-05-17
Honestly to get most of the health benefits of exercise the bar is quite low. 30 minutes of moderate exercise (think brisk walking pace) 5 times a week will get you 80% of the longevity benefits of exercise. To get 100% of the benefits you've got to be an elite athlete in a cardiovascular heavy sport (like tennis or running).

This is a separate issue than the longevity benefit of keeping a healthy weight. 
-------------------------------
1 : 2017-05-16
Fair enough. But this is not an issue that you'll find has been rigorously investigated with a properly designed RCT. Sometimes you've just gotta trust that something that makes a priori logical sense is probably good enough. 

I'll make this one last point against the insanity of teaching that valsalva is unsafe. If valsalva was unsafe - if our bodies physiologists literally exploded when we braced our cores - then there would be a strong correlation with stroke and constipation. Right? Or a correlation with stroke and orgasms. 

There is no physiologic blood pressure number high enough that it is unsafe in the short term. Valsalva is the shortest term possible. It causes a very transient rise in BP that by the end of the lift is leading to a drop in BP (due to decreases in preload). Elevated BP causes risks that are realized over months, years, decades. 

Now there are anecdotal data of people who have had strokes while lifting. There's also data about people stroking out while driving, nutting, sleeping, farting, walking, pissing, watching TV, and just about every other human activity imaginable. 

Don't trust everything your lecturers tell you.
-------------------------------
7 : 2017-05-15
+1 to this. The danger of hypertension is realized over months to years, not seconds. Valsalva is perfectly safe compared to the real and very uncool risk of disc herniation or just plain wrenching your back to shit. 

Source: medical school
-------------------------------
15 : 2017-05-15
Valsalva is not unsafe. Short spikes in blood pressure are not as dangerous as spinal injury. If your bodies physiology couldn't handle autocorrection of your blood pressure from second to second, you'd black out any time your head moved vertically more than about 6".

'Excess' protein can be used for energy as it's used in cellular metabolism in the ATP cycle, but if you're still lifting weights you'll still need a large protein intake to avoid muscle loss. 

I've been cutting for ~ 4 months and when I keep my protein intake high my lifts don't stagnate. In fact they've increased modestly. This isn't totally newbie gains either as I wasn't eating at a deficit at all for the first 6 months.  

Make sure you're adequately hydrated and you'll be fine. 
-------------------------------
3 : 2017-04-18
 I've been lifting and losing weight consistently for the last three months. Prior to losing the weight, I was lifting consistently. It was only in the last three months that I tightened up my diet. I have found that if I keep my protein intake very high, at least 1 g per kilogram of ideal body weight (Also known as my goal weight), my lifts don't suffer. I have no idea how many calories I burn when I'm lifting, and that's OK. I keep my calories under my goal. I haven't found that I'm running out of gas on a deficit . Unfortunately I can't really speak to cardio, because I hate cardio with the fiery passion of 1000 burning suns. 
-------------------------------
2 : 2017-04-17
Ate out tonight. It was a work thing. Tons of delicious options but I kept it simple. Salad with dressing on the side. Steak (oh so friggin delicious). Side of asparagus. Stayed away from the appetizers completely. Had an ultralight beer too. And I budgeted my calories for it and I'm STILL under my goal calories. Yeah!
-------------------------------
5 : 2017-04-17
Awesome work. You must be proud of yourself, because even this internet stranger is proud of your accomplishments. 

Did you find the divorce to be a huge motivation? 

Are you counting calories? How long did this journey take you?
-------------------------------
3 : 2017-04-17
Forgive yourself, log 4,000 calories or 5,000 or whatever, and move on. It take 3,500 calories above maintenance to gain a pound. Start right back at your deficit tomorrow. You've got this. You've been consistently awesome since September (and successfully lost 65 lbs!), one binge is not going to derail all your progress. 
-------------------------------
2 : 2017-04-17
What awesome responses. 

Forgive yourself, log the calories you ate, and move on. 

You've been consistently awesome for how long now? So you took a holiday weekend off. No big deal. 

You know, I'm convinced 'naturally thin' people do just that. They have big weekends or big days or even big meals, recognize that they overdid it, and 'naturally' restrict their calorie intake for however long it takes to offset their indulgences. I've got a sister in law who could and did consistently out-eat me at family gatherings before I began counting calories, who weighs like 110 lbs at 5'9. Model thin. She restricts herself before and after those family gatherings so she can indulge while around family. 

No one can escape the law of thermodynamics.

I eat oats nearly every day. 2 servings of unsweetened oats with a cup of frozen fruit, this is a super filling meal. I found that I needed more protein in it, so now I've taken to adding two eggs to the water and add the oats, whisking them all together, and cooking that on the stove while stirring the whole thing. I'll add cinnamon and nutmeg too. Yum. Add the frozen fruit at the end, and it's about 520 cal and is a GINORMOUS meal. 

I'll have to try it with egg whites alone sometime. 

I feel sorry for the shorties out there. This ginormous meal is ~25% of my daily cal limit. 

That being said, this works for ME. Oats aren't a magical salve that promotes weight loss better than different food. 
-------------------------------
3 : 2017-04-16
I was going to reply with something similar but a lot shorter than the above. Basically, this. 

I enjoy a Coke Zero from time to time, and it hasn't even touched my weight loss. I also drink monster energy drinks (again, zero calorie options) and sweeten my morning coffee with Truvia/stevia. This is an n of 1 but the science is sound. 
-------------------------------

-------------------------------
1 : 2017-04-15
Aw yes, you're an inspiration dude! 

I started at almost the exact same weight and am also 6' - one thing I've noticed helps me is making sure I'm eating a LOT of protein, like 150-200 g a day. 

I love pairing a bag of microwaveable steamed veggies (4-5 servings in a single bag for &lt; 150 calories) with a lot of grilled chicken or lean pork tenderloin. Man that fills me up, and it's still a meal that works out to less than 600 cal. 

I'm lifting also, but I've been lifting for a long time, and only recently got my diet under control. I'm in the thousand pound club (as in, my deadlift + bench + squat &gt; 1000 pounds) but that's not impressive when you weigh 315. One of the things that held me back in the past was fearing losing strength, but when I keep my protein intake high like it is, my lifts don't suffer. 
-------------------------------

What a great comment! Food is medicine, they say. Congratulations on your weight loss! You're doing awesome. 

One thing I'd add, is that a lot of chronic pain is really a side effect of depression. As in, the depression gets treated well, and the chronic pain gets better. You've experienced this yourself, and one thing that really stuck out to my from OPs comment was how much she had to be depressed about. I can't help much with the depression, but I'll echo the refrain, CICO works, and if you're mindful about what you're putting in your mouth, it'll work. Just keep at it.

What helped me stop putting it off was realizing my life was slipping away one day at a time. I'm not sure how I came to this realization, but once I did, I started tracking my calories immediately. 

In the last 3 months I've lost almost 50 lbs, plus made enormous gains on my lifts. It helps that I eat a ton of protein.

Maybe lifting weights would help you shape your body they way you want it to look? You're already cycling bulks and cuts, you're just not putting muscle where it needs to be.  I'd suggest you check out r/fitness and read the sidebar there. It's chock full of great information.

Professional auto on Linden ave always worked well for me. They guarantee parts and labor for 3 years of 36000 miles.

You don't usually tell the patient. Patients who are dying are usually too far gone to hear it. The tough conversations are with family. I usually summarize the course of care, say that we've done all we could, and they say that so-and-so has died. I make sure to say "died" or "dead". 

It doesn't get easier with practice.

Sounds like precordial catch syndrome. Essentially harmless.

Your elevated CK and myoglobin is likely just from your vigorous workouts.
